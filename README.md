# BioCCP
*The Coupon Collector's Problem for Combinatorial Biotechnology*

During the **combinatorial engineering of biosystems** such as proteins, genetic circuits and genomes, diverse libraries are generated by assembling and recombining modules. the variants with the optimal phenotype are selected with screening techniques. However, when the number of available modules to compose a biological designs increases, a combinatorial explosion of design possibilities arises, allowing only for a part of the libary to be analyzed. In this case, it is important for a researcher to get insight in which (minimal) sample size sufficiently covers the design space, i.e. what is the **minimal number of designs so that all modules are observed at least once**.

BioCCP contains functions for calculating minimum sample sizes and related statistics:
- `expectation_minsamplesize`
- std_minsamplesize
- success_probability
- expectation_fraction_collected
- prob_occurence_module

For more informatio about the implementation of the functions, please consult the docs.

The Pluto notebook provides an interactive illustration of these functionalities and allows to make calculations for specific settings.
